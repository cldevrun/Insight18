# README Spark

This is a README file for the Spark folder. Within the Spark folder, there are two folders, one for Kubernetes and one
for Docker. The Docker folder contains code I used to build my own Spark image, which then referenced within the spark
yaml file. 

To simply deploy, just ```kubectl apply -f spark.yml```
